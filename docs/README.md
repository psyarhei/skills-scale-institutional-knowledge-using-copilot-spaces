# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management knowledge base.  This folder centralizes all process documentation and serves as a single source of truth for how OctoAcme runs projects.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme follows a **customer-first, iterative, and evidence-driven** approach to project management. Our process emphasizes clear ownership, defined roles, formal artifacts, and consistent communication cadences to enable reliable, repeatable project execution.

### Key Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments with frequent feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has named owners (Project Manager and Product Lead)
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Foster feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Project Lifecycle
OctoAcme projects flow through five phases:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, stakeholders, and high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments with clear acceptance criteria
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on features
4. **Release**: Deploy to production with standardized checklists and rollback plans
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings and feed improvements back into process

### Core Roles

| Role | Focus | Key Responsibility |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **Product Manager** | Outcomes & Impact | Define problems, prioritize backlog, measure success |
| **Project Manager** | Delivery & Coordination | Manage schedules, risks, communications, and stakeholders |
| **Developers** | Implementation & Quality | Build features, write tests, collaborate on design |
| **QA/Testing** | Validation | Verify acceptance criteria and quality standards |
| **Stakeholders** | Business Alignment | Provide inputs, approve decisions, receive updates |

### Communication Cadence
- **Daily standups** (15 min): Progress, blockers, dependencies
- **Weekly PM + PdM sync**: Priorities, risks, cross-team coordination
- **Twice-weekly delivery standups**: Execution updates (or as agreed)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: High-level progress and milestones
- **Blameless retrospectives**: After sprints, releases, or incidents (45–75 min)

### Key Artifacts
- **Project One-pager**: Problem, goal, success metrics, stakeholders, timeline
- **Roadmap & Release Plan**: Long-term direction and milestone dates
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: Identified risks with impact, likelihood, and mitigation plans
- **Definition of Done**: Shared quality and acceptance standards
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and actionable improvements
